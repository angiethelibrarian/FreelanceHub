## Overview

FullStack Forum is an application designed to connect freelancers with clients for collaborative project work. The platform allows users to log in, view projects, and manage their contributions effectively.

As a freelance coder, I wanted a way to connect with other freelancers and manage projects seamlessly. The application is user-friendly, secure, and enables users to input details about new projects.

## Usage

Freelancers can use this application by entering their username and password to log in. 

After logging in, they are directed to the home page, where they can see projects posted by other users. 

By clicking on these projects, they can choose to accept offers to collaborate.

Clicking on the hamburger in the top corner can take them to their profile page, where they can see offers of projects that they have already accepted. 
On this page, they can also create a new project, which will then be displayed on the home page.

This site is also equipped with dark mode functionality. Each page has a dark/light mode toggle button within the hamburger in the upper right hand corner.

## Future Enhancements (Coming Soon)

- Profile Page with a list of projects you have accepted
- Project Details- upon clicking on a project, this will give you the option to view details and accept the project
