## Overview

An application that connects freelancers with clients based on skills, project type, and budget.

As a freelance coder, I want a way to connect with other freelancers on their projects. I wanted it to be easily readable and accessible by logging in with a username and password. It should be usable by other freelancers just like me. It should information on each project. It should display any projects I have created or joined on a separate profile page.

## Usage

Freelancers can use this page by entering a username and password. After logging in, they will be taken to the home page, where they can see projects posted by other users. By clicking on these projects, they can choose to accept the offer to become part of the project. Clicking on the hamburger in the top corner can take them to their profile page, where they can see offers of projects that they have already accepted. On this page, they can also create a new project, which will then be displayed on the home page.

This site is also equipped with dark mode functionality. Each page has a dark/light mode toggle button within the hamburger in the upper right hand corner.
